pa : display a readable PATH variable
	rewrite entries using a blessed ary, and replace 
		->[0] by ->index,
		->[1] by ->original_path, 
		->[2] by ->normalized_path,
	pa --check : check for duplicated, bad paths and size limitation
	pa --edit : interactively edit path order and entries.
	pa --enable/disable entry : additional entries managment
	pa --useconf confname : works with the confname configuration
	pa --addconf confname : merge current config with confname
	pa --optimize : can reduce path size by removing duplicated entries, 
			use short path name, 
			remove double-quotes, 
			use ENV vars if shorten : does not work! 

	pa --backup|B : backup current PATH into a special file/subfolder
		based on localtime, and restorable easily with 
			./pa/backups/2013-10-02-14h42m21s.cmd
	pa --restore|R ?
	
	* which without extension should look in PATHEXT
	* extend which command to look at registry HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths
		so it can read more path when an app is existing as a sub key?
	* when called with no commands (-X or --xx), it will act as PATH command.
